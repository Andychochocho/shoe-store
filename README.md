# Shoe Store

#### A site to test my skills for week four at Epicodus(Spring 2016 C# Cohort)

#### By Andrew Cho

## Description

_I used BDD in order to test every aspect of the logic until fully complete. I then utilized Nancy and Razor libraries to complete this project. I had used databases in this particular project in order to store my data in the server to later be called from within the site. I used the ideology of Restful Routing to implement my routing correctly. I used a join table for a many to many relationship with my tables as a basis for the whole project_


## Setup/Installation Requirements
-Clone the repository.
-Use .sql files to implement the databases needed

## Known Bugs
